# README.md - Effectors

## Overview

This directory contains an example iPython notebook which demonstrates the influence of effector base rate occurrence on the probability that a sequence predicted by an effecor classifier is truly an effector. The notebook contains an interactive plotting example that will only work correctly with iPython v2 or greater.

## Running the notebook

At the command line, issue

```
ipython notebook
```

and click on the filename `pred_acc.ipynb`, to start the notebook.

(you can see example output at [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/widdowquinn/Teaching-EMBL-Plant-Path-Genomics/blob/master/data/Effectors/pred_acc.ipynb))
