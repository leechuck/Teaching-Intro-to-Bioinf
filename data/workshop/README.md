# README.md - chromosomes

Four draft bacterial assemblies are represented as chromosomes in the files
`chr*.fasta`, with their assembled contigs in `chr*_contigs.gff`. Functional
annotations are given in `chr*_iprscan.raw` (InterPro) and `chr*_RAST.gff` 
(RAST).

A script to convert `glimmer3` output to GFF: `glimmer_to_gff.py` is also 
provided.
