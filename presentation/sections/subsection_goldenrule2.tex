  \frametitle{Second Golden Rule of Bioinformatics}
  \framesubtitle{Do not trust the software}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Do not trust the software: it is not an authority
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Software does not distinguish meaningful from meaningless data
      \item Software has bugs
      \item Algorithms have assumptions, conditions, and applicable domains
      \item Some problems are inherently hard, or even insoluble
    \end{itemize}
    \item You must understand the analysis/algorithm
    \item Always sanity test (controls!)
    \item Test output for robustness to parameter (including data) choice
  \end{itemize}
