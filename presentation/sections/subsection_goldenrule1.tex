  \framesubtitle{Do not trust the data}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Always inspect the raw data (trends, outliers, clustering)
    \item What is the question? Can the data answer it?
    \item Communicate with data collectors! (don't be afraid of pedantry)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Who? When? How?
      \item You need to understand the experiment to analyse it (easier if you helped design it).
      \item Be wary of block effects (experimenter, time, batch, etc.)
    \end{itemize}
