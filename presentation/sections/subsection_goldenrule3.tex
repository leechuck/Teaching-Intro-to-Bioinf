  \frametitle{Third Golden Rule of Bioinformatics}
  \framesubtitle{Don't trust yourself}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Everyone has expectations of their data/experiment
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Beware cognitive errors, such as confirmation bias!
      \item System 1 vs. System 2 $\approx$ intuition vs. reason
    \end{itemize}
    \item Think statistically! 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Large datasets can be counterintuitive and appear to confirm a large number of contradictory hypotheses
      \item Always account for multiple tests.
      \item Avoid ``data dredging'': intensive computation is not an adequate substitute for expertise
    \end{itemize}
    \item Use test-driven development of analyses and code
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Use examples that pass \textit{and} fail
    \end{itemize}	  
  \end{itemize}
